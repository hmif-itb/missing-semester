# Creating your first post

## Create your author profile

The first step before writing your own blog post is to create your author profile under `blog/authors.yml`, complete your profile with the following format:

```yml
{tag_name}:
  name: {author name}
  url: {url to author profile}
  image_url: {image profile}
  page: true
  socials:
    {socials}: {social links/username}
```

## Start writing your blog post

After creating your author profile, you can start writing your own blog post:

1. Create a folder with the format \{yyyy-mm-dd-title\} under `blog/`
2. Create an `attachments` folder in the folder if necessary
3. Create a `index.md` file in the folder (use template), and start writing!

There are also other alternatives:

1. If you don't need attachments, you can create the blog post directly in the folder, but it is recommended to create your blog post inside a folder
2. If you need an interactive post, you can use `.mdx` files for your blog post, that can interact with user using JSX directly in the file
3. You can also add tags in the `blog/tags.yml` file if you need, it is recommended to create your own tag or use tags relevant to your topic
